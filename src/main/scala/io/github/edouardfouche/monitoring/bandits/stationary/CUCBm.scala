/**
  * CUCB as described in "Combinatorial Multi-Armed BanditK: General Framework, Results and Applications" (Chen2013)
  * This version is combined with ADWIN
  *
  * @param stream          a stream simulator on which we let this bandit run
  * @param reward          the reward function which derives the gains for each action
  * @param scalingstrategy the scaling strategy, which decides how many arms to pull for the next step
  * @param k               the initial number of pull per round
  * @note when logfactor = 3/2, this is indeed as described in Chen 2013
  * @note when logfactor = 1/2, this is as "Thompson Sampling for Combinatorial Semi-Bandits" (Wang 2018) (Named CUCB-m therein)
  * @note the implementation is actually closer to "Improving Regret Bounds for Combinatorial Semi-Bandits with Probabilistically Triggered Arms and Its Applications" (Wang 2017)
